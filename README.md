This readme file provides an overview of the Azure Infrastructure created using Terraform scripts. It provides an understanding of the project, its purpose, prerequisites, and how to use it.

## Project Overview
The project is a set of Terraform scripts that create an infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. The infrastructure includes a virtual network, subnets, security groups, network security groups, and a virtual machine. The virtual machine is configured with an operating system and other software as required.

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide a template for creating a basic infrastructure on Azure. The scripts are designed to be customized to meet the specific requirements of a project. This provides a faster and more consistent way of creating the infrastructure.

# Prerequisites
- An Azure account with permissions to create resources.
- Terraform installed on the machine where the scripts will be run.
- Basic knowledge of Terraform and Azure.

## How to Use the Project
1. Clone the project repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a terraform.tfvars file in the project directory with the required variables. Use the terraform.tfvars.example file as a template.
4. Initialize Terraform by running the terraform init command in the terminal.
5. Run the terraform plan command to preview the changes that Terraform will make to the infrastructure.
6. Run the terraform apply command to create the infrastructure on Azure.
7. When you are finished with the infrastructure, run the terraform destroy command to delete all resources created by Terraform.

## Files and Directories
The project contains the following files and directories:

- apigateway.tf, appservice.tf, firewall.tf, VM.tf: The main Terraform files that defines the infrastructure.
- variables.tf: The file that defines the input variables for the Terraform scripts.
- terraform.tfvars.example: An example terraform.tfvars file with the required variables.
- README.md: This file.
- .gitignore: The file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

## Conclusion
The Azure Infrastructure created with Terraform scripts provides a consistent and reproducible way of creating an infrastructure on Azure. The project can be customized to meet specific requirements, and the provided readme file can help users understand the project's purpose and how to use it.

## Additional Notes
The project can be extended to include additional resources such as storage accounts, CloudDefender, and databases.
The Terraform scripts can be modified to include additional customization such as configuring virtual machines with custom scripts, adding extensions, and creating additional network security groups.
The project is provided as-is, and no support is guaranteed. However, feedback is always welcome, and issues and pull requests can be submitted on the project's GitHub repository.
